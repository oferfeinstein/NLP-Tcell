Open Information Extraction

* parsed_text.py: Parses and tokenizes abstracts from a JSONL file, generating a new JSONL file with parsed abstracts.
Implements a ParsedAbstract class to read an input JSONL file, tokenize the abstracts into sentences, and write the processed abstracts to a new JSONL file.
Accepts an input JSONL file containing abstracts and outputs a new JSONL file with parsed abstracts.

* run_open_ie: Performs Open Information Extraction (OIE) on parsed abstracts, extracting information and storing it in a new JSONL file.
Employs AllenNLP's pre-trained models for Open Information Extraction tasks on parsed abstracts.
Processes parsed abstracts from a JSONL file and produces a new JSONL file with the extracted information using AllenNLP's models.
Takes an input JSONL file with parsed abstracts and outputs a new JSONL file containing extracted information.
