# Integrative Modeling of T-cell Activation Using NLP

This project aims to develop an information extraction pipeline utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for integrative modeling of T-cell activation.
The project encompasses data preparation, processing, model fine-tuning, and database construction from an extensive dataset comprising millions of scientific papers.

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an NLP-based pipeline capable of extracting pertinent information from a vast corpus of scientific literature.
Specifically, the project focuses on T-cell activation, utilizing cutting-edge NLP methodologies to process large-scale data efficiently.

Key Components

1. Data Preparation and Processing
Data Collection: Gathering a substantial dataset comprising millions of papers related to T-cell activation.
Filtering by Fields of Study: Filtering papers based on specific fields of study related to immunology and related disciplines pertinent to T-cell activation.
Keyword Filtering: Applying keyword-based filters to extract papers containing relevant phrases or terms related to T-cell activation in their abstracts.
Data Tagging for Relevance: Tagging papers according to their relevance to T-cell activation or specific subsets within the domain, marking them as relevant or non-relevant for further processing.

2. Model Fine-Tuning
Model Training: Fine-tuning BERT model using the collected dataset to enhance accuracy and performance.
Validation and Optimization: Evaluating and optimizing model performance to achieve the highest precision and recall.

3. Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)
Information Extraction Model: Employing an OpenIE model to extract structured information and relationships from the papers.

4. Database Construction
Database Creation: Building a structured database from the extracted information for easy access and utilization in integrative modeling tasks.
